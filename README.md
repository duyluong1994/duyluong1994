I’ve worked as a full-stack developer since 2017. I did some projects like building smart contracts, server (AI integrated), dapp web, web app and mobile app, off-chain services (api, cron jobs, discord/Twitter bots, syncing on-chain table to off-chain database, on-chain event sockets,...)

Skills:  Node.js / REACT / Svelte / Python / Flutter / C++ (Antelope) /  NEXT.js / Solidity / TypeScripts  / Docker / K8s 

My recent work experience is MagneticAI for an US company. This project includes:
- A web app, https://www.magneticai.co, using React and deployed via Vercel. It allows women to register using AI-powered KYC verification, then rate men's photos and receive rewards via PayPal.

- A server and Telegram bot deployed on a Hetzner VPS system using Grok/Gemini/ChatGPT AI APIs, Node.js, Postgresql, Redis, and Python. The server's main task is to provide APIs for mobile and web apps, collect rating data from the web app to fine-tune the AI ​​model, and improve results for mobile app users. The Telegram bot allows administrators to interact with the system quickly.

- A mobile app published on the Apple Store: https://apps.apple.com/vn/app/magneticai-for-men/id6752293169, serving male customers, allowing them to submit photos and receive reviews to improve their images. There are subscription packages ranging from free to paid through Apple's IAP system.
